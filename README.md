# Objective Ethics Framework (OEF)

The Objective Ethics Framework (OEF) is a coordination architecture designed to embed structured, auditable, and adaptive ethical reasoning into AI systems. Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose static moral principles, the OEF enables real-time routing, prioritization, and justification of ethical decisions using modular tools, heuristics, and recursive oversight.

This repository contains the full OEF whitepaper, visual routing diagram, glossary, and supporting resources for public reference and non-commercial development.

## 🔍 What Is the OEF?

The OEF is not a moral framework. It is a coordination system that:
- Assigns ethical evaluation tiers via contextual triage
- Routes decisions through logic modules, ethical processors, or human review
- Coordinates evidence, heuristics, and recursion
- Audits outcomes and supports long-term adaptive refinement

It is designed to work with any ethical input—bioethics, legal norms, or discipline-specific heuristics—without originating its own values.

## 🧭 Visual: Tier Routing Overview

Each tier routes decisions differently based on context and risk:

- **Tier 1:** System Logic → Execution  
- **Tier 2:** EAP → System Logic → Execution  
- **Tier 3:** EAP → Logic → RAP → Execution  
- **Tier 4:** EAP → Logic → RAP → Human  
- **Tier 5:** Direct to Human Oversight

Decision Evaluation Protocol (Preliminary Draft)

This is the preliminary version of the Decision Evaluation Protocol (DEP) — part of the Kraken AI Governance model and built to operationalize the Objective Ethics Framework (OEF) in real-world decision-making.

The DEP is designed to:

Provide a structured, repeatable method for evaluating high-stakes or complex decisions
Bridge ethical principles with applied workflows
Support transparency, accountability, and adaptability in rapidly changing environments

Important notes:

This is an early-stage working draft. Expect changes as it’s refined through testing and feedback.
Examples, test cases, and integrations are still in development.
If you want to suggest improvements or see edge cases covered, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
