# Objective Ethics Framework (OEF)

The Objective Ethics Framework (OEF) is a coordination architecture designed to embed structured, auditable, and adaptive ethical reasoning into AI systems. Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose static moral principles, the OEF enables real-time routing, prioritization, and justification of ethical decisions using modular tools, heuristics, and recursive oversight.

This repository contains the full OEF whitepaper, visual routing diagram, glossary, and supporting resources for public reference and non-commercial development.

## 🔍 What Is the OEF?

The OEF is not a moral framework. It is a coordination system that:
- Assigns ethical evaluation tiers via contextual triage
- Routes decisions through logic modules, ethical processors, or human review
- Coordinates evidence, heuristics, and recursion
- Audits outcomes and supports long-term adaptive refinement

It is designed to work with any ethical input—bioethics, legal norms, or discipline-specific heuristics—without originating its own values.

## 🧭 Visual: Tier Routing Overview

Each tier routes decisions differently based on context and risk:

- **Tier 1:** System Logic → Execution  
- **Tier 2:** EAP → System Logic → Execution  
- **Tier 3:** EAP → Logic → RAP → Execution  
- **Tier 4:** EAP → Logic → RAP → Human  
- **Tier 5:** Direct to Human Oversight
